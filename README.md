# Roadmap.sh Learning Projects

Welcome! This repository is a personal learning journal where I’m building hands-on projects while following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) guides. The goal is to learn by doing — applying each concept through code and gradually building a strong foundation across the **Frontend**, **Backend**, and eventually **Fullstack** paths.

---

## Overview 

Rather than passively consuming tutorials or articles, I’m focusing on building real-world projects aligned with the skills and milestones outlined in roadmap.sh. Each folder in this repo corresponds to a major domain in web development.

This is a long-term journey where I will be:

- Starting with the **Frontend**
- Adding **Backend** projects in parallel as I advance
- Moving toward **Fullstack** apps once I'm confident in both

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```bash
.
├── frontend/       # HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc.
│   └── single-page-cv/ # Project Info: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
├── backend/        # Node.js, APIs, databases, etc.
├── fullstack/      # Combined frontend + backend projects
└── README.md

```

# Goals for This Journey

- Stay consistent with the roadmap.sh progression
- Build practical skills through real-world examples
- Use version control (Git) for every project
- Document progress to reflect on improvements

# How to Run Locally

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/Vedantha-V-V/roadmap-projects.git
    cd roadmap-projects

```

## Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the appropriate environment set up (Node.js for frontend/JavaScript backend, Python for Python-based projects, etc.).

## Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+ recommended)
npm or yarn
